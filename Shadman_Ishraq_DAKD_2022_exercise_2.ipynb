    "The previous exercise was about <i>data understanding</i> and <i>data preparation</i>, which formed the basis for the modeling phase of the data mining process. Many modeling techniques make assumptions about data so the exploration and preparation phases can't be ignored. Now, as we have checked the validity of data and familiarized ourselves with it, we can move on to the next stage of the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) which is <font color = darkorchid><i>modeling</i></font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questions to be answered at this stage could be for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What kind of model architecture best fits our data?\n",
    "- How well does the model perform technically?\n",
    "- Could we improve that performance?\n",
    "- How the performance of the model is evaluated?\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Machine learning</i> is a subfield of artificial intelligence which provides automatic, objective and data-driven techniques for modeling the data. The machine learning algorithms aim to learn from data to make predictions. The two main branches of it are <i>supervised learning</i> and <i>unsupervised learning</i>.  In this exercise, we are going to use the former -- <font color = darkorchid><i>supervised learning</i></font> -- for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification, data remains the same as in the previous exercise, but I've already cleaned it up for you. Some data pre-processing steps are still required to ensure that it's in an appropriate format, so that models can learn something from it. Even though we are not doing any major data exploration nor data preparation here this time, <i>you should <b>never</b> forget it in your future data analyses</i>.\n",
